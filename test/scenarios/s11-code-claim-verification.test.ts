/**
 * Scenario S11 — Code claim verification gates staleness.
 *
 * Falsifies L4: "Reconfirm file paths, symbols, tests, and branch-sensitive
 * claims before repeating them. If verification fails, drop the claim's
 * authority for the current answer while preserving the historical
 * operational record."
 *
 * Current gap (spec §5): the entire Code Claim Verification Protocol from
 * docs/architecture/redesign/02-memory-loop-and-protocols.md is
 * unimplemented. No code path reconfirms file paths, symbols, or branch
 * state. `retrieval_traces.verification` exists in the schema but no caller
 * populates it with code-claim-specific entries.
 *
 * Fix direction (spec §5): add a `reverify_code_claims({ trace_id })`
 * operation that re-checks file/symbol/branch assertions in the trace
 * against the current worktree and produces a `stale | current | unverifiable`
 * marker. Wire it into the resume path.
