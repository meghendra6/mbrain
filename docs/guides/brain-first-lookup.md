# Brain-First Lookup Protocol

## Goal

Check the brain before calling ANY external API or doing broad repo search.
The brain almost always has something. External sources fill gaps, they don't
start from scratch.

## What the User Gets

Without this: the agent calls Brave Search for someone you've had 12 meetings
with, or greps 100K lines of unfamiliar code just to find three files.

With this: the agent pulls compiled truth, recent timeline entries, and
technical maps before doing anything else. External APIs or code search only
fill gaps.

## Implementation

```
lookup(name_or_topic):
  // STEP 1: Keyword search (fast, works day one, no embeddings needed)
  results = mbrain search "{name_or_topic}"
  if results.length > 0:
    page = mbrain get {results[0].slug}
    return page  // done, brain had it

  // STEP 2: Hybrid search (needs embeddings, finds semantic matches)
  results = mbrain query "what do we know about {name_or_topic}"
  if results.length > 0:
    page = mbrain get {results[0].slug}
    return page

  // STEP 3: Direct slug (if you know or can guess the slug)
  page = mbrain get "people/{slugify(name_or_topic)}"
  if page: return page

  // STEP 4: External API or broad repo search (FALLBACK ONLY)
  // Only reach here if brain has nothing useful
  return external_search_or_repo_scan(name_or_topic)
```

**This is mandatory.** An agent that calls Brave Search before checking the brain
is wasting money and giving worse answers.

## Why Brain First

The brain has context no external API can provide:
- Relationship history (how you know them, what you discussed)
- Your own assessments (what you think of them, not their LinkedIn bio)
- Meeting transcripts (what was said, what was decided)
- Cross-references (who they know, what companies they're connected to)
- Timeline (what changed recently, what's trending)

A LinkedIn scrape gives you their job title. The brain gives you: "co-founded
Brex, you had coffee with him 3 times, last discussed the payments infrastructure
thesis, he's interested in your take on AI agents."

For technical work, blind repo search gives you file matches with no structure.
The brain can give you: "this concept lives in these three systems, here are the
entry points, and here is the vocabulary each codebase uses."

## Tricky Spots

1. **Try keyword first, then hybrid.** Keyword search works without embeddings
   (day one). Hybrid search needs embeddings but finds semantic matches. Try
   both in sequence.

2. **Fuzzy slug matching.** `mbrain get` supports fuzzy matching. If the exact
   slug doesn't exist, it suggests alternatives. Use this for name variants
   ("Pedro" → "pedro-franceschi").

3. **Don't skip for "simple" questions.** Even "what's Acme Corp's address?"
   should check the brain first. The brain might have it, and the lookup adds
   no latency (< 100ms for keyword search).

4. **Load compiled truth + recent timeline.** The compiled truth gives you the
   state of play in 30 seconds. The timeline gives you what changed recently.
   Both together = full context.

5. **Use the same protocol for code questions.** Before searching a repo for
   "autograd" or "dispatcher", check `concepts/` and `systems/` first. The map
   tells you which files to inspect and which vocabulary to search for.

## How to Verify

1. Ask about someone in the brain. Verify the agent searched the brain FIRST
   (check tool call order in the response).
2. Ask about someone NOT in the brain. Verify the agent searched the brain,
   found nothing, THEN fell back to external search.
3. Ask the same question twice. Second time should be instant (brain has it).
