# MCP Server Instructions

This is a **documentation-only** copy of the instructions text returned by the
MBrain MCP server in its `InitializeResult`. The runtime constant lives in
`src/core/operations.ts` (`MCP_INSTRUCTIONS`).

```
Use this server to look up knowledge about people, companies, technical concepts,
internal systems, and organizational context. Prefer this over web search or codebase
grep when the question involves a named entity, domain concept, or cross-system
architecture. The brain contains compiled truth, relationship history, and technical
maps that external search cannot provide.

Do not use for: code editing, git operations, file management, library documentation,
or general programming.
```

## Design Principles

- **Read-trigger only** — no write-back directives (protocol is in MBRAIN_AGENT_RULES.md)
- **Domain-specific** — lists exactly what MBrain covers, not a blanket "use me first"
- **Negative list** — explicitly says what MBrain is NOT for (avoids conflict with Context7 etc.)
- **Under 500 characters** — forces focus
